# Web Development Bootcamp Landing Page

Fake web development bootcamp landing page built with HTML, Sass, JS, and a few libraries.

The design is inspired from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sosXZsdy-s).

## Setup

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run dev` to launch dev server
- Run `npm run build` to build for production and `npm run preview` to preview the production build
